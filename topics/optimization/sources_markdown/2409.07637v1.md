**1. Introduction**

The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into power grids presents significant challenges
due to their intrinsic stochasticity and uncertainty, necessitating the development of new techniques for
reliable and efficient forecasting. This paper proposes a method combining probabilistic forecasting
and Gaussian copula for day-ahead prediction and scenario generation of load, wind, and solar power
in high-dimensional contexts. By incorporating weather covariates and restoring spatio-temporal
correlations, the proposed method enhances the reliability of probabilistic forecasts in RES. Extensive
numerical experiments compare the effectiveness of different time series models, with performance
evaluated using comprehensive metrics on a real-world and high-dimensional dataset from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The results highlight the importance of weather
information and demonstrate the efficacy of the Gaussian copula in generating realistic scenarios,
with the proposed weather-informed Temporal Fusion Transformer (WI-TFT) model showing superior
performance.



The adoption of Renewable Energy Sources (RES),
especially wind and solar generation, is at the forefront
of modern power systems’ transition towards sustainable
and carbon-free electricity generation. This transition also
promises to improve the affordability and accessibility of
energy systems worldwide (U.S. Department of Energy,
n.d.a,n). However, integrating high levels of RES into existing power grids introduces significant challenges, particularly in forecasting. Indeed, RES, whose output depends
on weather conditions, are intrinsically intermittent and
stochastic. This operational uncertainty thus complicates
grid stability and optimization efforts (U.S. Department
of Energy, n.d.a) which, in turn, motivates the need for
advanced forecasting tools.
In that context, academics and practitioners have increasingly moved from deterministic to _probabilistic_ forecasting, which better captures the uncertainty in load and
RES output. In addition, probabilistic forecasts provide the
ability to sample multiple scenarios, which is essential for
risk quantification (Stover, Karve and Mahadevan, 2023) and
uncertainty-aware optimization (Knueven, Faqiry, Garcia,
Chen, Treinen, Werho, Zhang, Vittal, Zhao, Thatte and
Yin, 2023). Despite their popularity, probabilistic forecasts
present substantial scalability challenges. Indeed, they must
capture _spatial_ (between system elements located at different

locations), and _temporal_ (between different time periods)
correlations. Typical forecasting tasks comprise hundreds
of renewable generators and dozens of time steps (e.g. 48
hours), with output dimensions in tens of thousands, and correlation matrices with hundreds of millions of coefficients.
To address these challenges, this paper focuses on the
development of high-dimensional probabilistic forecasting
methods for load and RES generation. By utilizing weather
information as covariates and restoring the spatio-temporal
correlations among the prediction variables, this paper sets
the foundation for reliable scenario generation using highdimensional multivariate time series forecasting in RES.


**1.1. Related Work**

_**1.1.1. Time Series Forecasting**_
Historically, the domain of time series prediction was
dominated by statistical methods, with Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (Ho and Xie, 1998)
model being a prominent example. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the non-linear and nonstationary nature of the time series and might not be reliable for forecasting RES. The advent of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) marked a significant shift, demonstrating superior capabilities in capturing complex temporal dependencies inherent in time series data (Sutskever,
Vinyals and Le, 2014; Smyl, 2020). Notably, the sequenceto-sequence (S2S) RNN architecture (Sutskever et al., 2014),
initially developed for neural machine translation, has inspired the development of innovative time series forecasting models such as multi-quantile RNN (Wen, Torkkola,
Narayanaswamy and Madeka, 2017), DeepAR model (Salinas, Flunkert, Gasthaus and Januschowski, 2020), and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) (Lim, Arık, Loeff and Pfister, 2021). By leveraging cross-series and cross-temporal
learning, these methods have gained promising performance

Probabilistic Forecasting and Scenario Generation



across diverse fields, which motivates their utilization for
RES forecasting (Dong, Sheng and Yang, 2018; Wilms,
Cupelli, Monti and Gross, 2019; Srivastava, Vedanshu and
Tripathi, 2020). For a comprehensive survey of the recent
advancements in RNN-based and general deep learning architectures in time series forecasting, readers are referred to
Hewamalage, Bergmeir and Bandara (2021) and Lim and
Zohren (2021).
Despite their significant advancements, RNN-based models and their derivatives encounter substantial challenges in
accurately forecasting the dynamics of modern power systems. These challenges stem largely from the intermittency,
uncertainty, and stochasticity associated with the integration of RES and distributed energy resources into existing
power networks (Shi, Liang and Dinavahi, 2018). Such
complexities highlights the urgent need to pivot from the
deterministic forecasting approaches to uncertainty quantification of forecast errors (Pinson, Nielsen, Møller, Madsen
and Kariniotakis, 2007; Bremnes, 2004). Many studies have
adopted parametric approaches to model the distribution
of forecast errors, utilizing distributions such as the beta
distribution (Bludszuweit, Dominguez-Navarro and Llombart, 2008) and the logit-normal distribution (Pinson, 2012).
These approaches, while valuable, often presume a specific
functional form for the forecast errors, which may not always
align with the observed data. In contrast, non-parametric
methods, particularly quantile regression, offer a more flexible solution (Pinson et al., 2007; Wan, Lin, Wang, Song and
Dong, 2017). Quantile regression excels in providing a comprehensive quantification of uncertainty without the need to
assume a predetermined functional form or distribution of
forecast errors. This methodological flexibility is especially
pertinent in addressing the complexities of stochastic power
systems, thereby enhancing decision-making processes in
critical operations such as risk management, unit commitment, economic dispatch, and optimal decision-making
(Holttinen, Milligan, Ela, Menemenlis, Dobschinski, Rawn,
Bessa, Flynn, Gomez-Lazaro and Detlefsen, 2012; Sioshansi
and Hurlbut, 2010). Additionally, there is growing interest in leveraging multivariate time series prediction over
univariate models to better capture output dependencies.
Recent studies, such as Mashlakov, Kuronen, Lensu, Kaarna
and Honkapuro (2021), have adopted multivariate time
series prediction approaches for forecasting load, wind, solar
power, and price within power systems. However, these
studies typically focus on zonal-level forecasting, which
diverges from the generator-level analysis prevalent in most
power flow problems. Furthermore, these approaches often
overlook the correlations between different forecasting dimensions, a critical factor for effective scenario generation.
The integration of weather forecast covariates, which can
significantly influence forecasting accuracy, is also absent in
their model. Another limitation of prior research is its focus
on small-scale datasets and problem settings, which may not
capture the complexity and scalability required for broader
applications. This paper addresses these shortcomings by



employing a combination of the copula method with multivariate forecasting approaches on a large-scale problem.


_**1.1.2. Scenario Generation in RES**_

Scenario generation in power systems is the process of
creating diverse and possible future states of the system, accounting for uncertainties caused by different factors such as
temperature and other weather-related variable fluctuations,
which affects the power consumption and generation within
the RES. Various methods have been proposed for scenario
generation in power systems, including sampling-based approaches (e.g., Monte Carlo sampling, latin hypercube sampling) (Carmona and Yang, 2021; Saraninezhad, Ramezani
and Falaghi, 2022) and optimization-based methods (e.g.,
moment matching, distance matching) (Li, Zhou and Chen,
2020; Liao, Yang, Chen and Li, 2022; Lu, Wu and Wu,
2021). While these methods are foundational, they often require extensive datasets and/or are computationally demanding, particularly for generating high-dimensional scenarios.
Moreover, when these methods are applied to individual
dimensions (i.e., marginal distributions), they struggle to
capture the critical spatio-temporal correlations present in
the system.
Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have
been employed in power systems scenario generation, notably within wind power generation, as demonstrated in
(Zhang, Ai, Xiao, Hao and Lu, 2020; Dong, Chen and Yang,
2022; Tan, Qi, Sun, Li, Yang and Li, 2020). These methods
have been demonstrated to be effective in capturing the
dynamic and complex patterns inherent in RES, thereby
providing a robust framework for simulating realistic and
diverse energy production scenarios. Dong et al. applies a
data-driven GAN model to wind and solar scenario generation, however, weather information was not incorporated
in the model (Dong et al., 2022). Zhang et al. utilized a
point-prediction forecasting model, using GAN to learn the
distribution of forecast errors and generate scenarios by
adding generated residuals to the point forecasts, making
the model’s performance highly dependent on the accuracy
of the initial forecasts (Zhang et al., 2020). Chen et al. also
applied GANs to generate solar and wind scenarios, with a
model that can condition on certain weather events, however
does not include the weather time series such as wind speed
and solar irradiation and can result in low performance
(Chen, Wang, Kirschen and Zhang, 2018). Furthermore,
training GANs presents significant challenges, especially
when dealing with the high-dimensional forecasting problems in RES.

The integration of the copula method with time series forecasting presents a promising solution to the aforementioned challenges by facilitating the modeling of the
joint distribution. For example, the DeepVAR model utilizes a Gaussian copula to model the time-varying mutualdependence structure, incorporating a low-rank structure on
the Gaussian copula covariance to enhance computational
efficiency (Salinas, Bohlke-Schneider, Callot, Medico and
Gasthaus, 2019). However, DeepVAR assumes stationarity

Probabilistic Forecasting and Scenario Generation



in the time series, an assumption often violated in the context
of RES. An alternative strategy involves using copula methods as a post-processing step to combine predicted marginal
distributions, where the covariance matrix of the Gaussian
copula captures temporal dependencies (Golestaneh, Gooi
and Pinson, 2016). The application of copulas effectively
bridges the gap between probabilistic forecasting models and
the generation of realistic spatio-temporal scenarios. Gaussian copulas, in particular, have been extensively explored in
the realm of wind power scenario generation, employing an
exponential covariance function to address situations with
limited historical observations (Ma, Sun and Fang, 2013;
Bessa, 2016). Additionally, recursive methods have been
employed in wind power forecasting to refine scenario generation processes (Pinson, Madsen, Nielsen, Papaefthymiou
and Klöckl, 2009).


**2. Contributions**


To address the existing gaps within high-dimensional
forecasting in RES, this paper introduces a comprehensive
probabilistic multivariate time series forecasting framework
that leverages Gaussian copulas for enhanced forecasting
and realistic scenario generation of load, and wind and solar
power generation. The proposed model is augmented with
both historical and forthcoming weather forecast covariates,
aiming at improving forecasting and scenario generation performance across various temporal and spatial dimensions.
The principal contributions of this paper are threefold:


  - Integration of multivariate time series forecasting with
copula method for high-dimensional problem in RES
to effectively capture the complex spatial and temporal
dependencies. Particularly, the largest problem is a 48hour ahead prediction for 376 solar farms, with an
output dimension of 10,848.


  - Showcasing the importance of incorporating weather
forecast data, which significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of forecasting and scenario generation processes, especially for higher prediction lead
times.


  - Comprehensive benchmarking and comparison of various time series prediction methodologies, including
ARIMA, DeepAR, NLinear, DLinear, and TFT, combined with Gaussian copula. Different metrics are
considered to evaluate the efficacy of these models
in multi-dimensional forecasting and scenario generation within power systems.


The analysis encompasses time series forecasting methods for the prediction and scenario generation of load, and
wind and solar power generation within the Midcontinent
Independent System Operator (MISO) system. In contrast
with previous methods, which are mainly on small and/or
low-dimensional datasets, this work considers probabilistic
forecasting of a large-scale system with 6 load zones, 286



wind farms and 376 solar farms. The proposed WeatherInformed (WI) TFT model is highlighted for its superior
performance across multiple evaluation metrics, in both deterministic forecasting and scenario generation. The findings
of this paper showcase the comparative effectiveness of
different forecasting techniques within the context of energy
forecasting and uncertainty quantification, thus providing
critical insights for risk-aware decision making in power
system operations.


**3. Problem Formulation**


This section outlines the problem formulation and introduces the notations used for the probabilistic multivariate
time series forecasting of load, and wind and solar power
generation, that incorporates weather data.


**3.1. Problem Setting**
Let _𝑍_ _𝑖,𝑡_ denote a random variable corresponding to the
target _𝑖_ ∈  = {1 _, .., 𝐷_ } (i.e., a load, a wind farm, or a solar
farm) at time _𝑡_ ∈ ℤ, and denote its realization as _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝑡_ ∈ ℝ.
The vector realization of all joint observations at time _𝑡_ is
defined as:


**𝐳** _.,𝑡_ = ( _𝑧_ 1 _,𝑡_ _, ..., 𝑧_ _𝐷,𝑡_ ) ∈ ℝ _[𝐷]_ (1)


For instance, in the context of wind farms, _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝑡_ represents
the output generated power of wind farm _𝑖_ at time _𝑡_, measured in megawatts (MW), and **𝐳** _.,_ **𝐭** is the vector representing
output of all wind farms at time _𝑡_ . Similarly, for an individual
target _𝑖_, the realization of the univariate time series for time
interval  = { _𝑡_ + 1 _, ..., 𝑡_ + _𝑇_ } _⊆_ ℤ is denoted by:


**𝐳** _𝑖,_  = ( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝑡_ +1 _, ..., 𝑧_ _𝑖,𝑡_ + _𝑇_ ) ∈ ℝ _[𝑇]_ (2)


Hence, the multivariate time series realization corresponding to the targets in the system from time _𝑡_ + 1 to _𝑡_ + _𝑇_ is
denoted as:



The details corresponding to each target and the covariates
are discussed in Section 6.



**𝐳** ⋅ _,_  = ⎛⎜— **𝐳** 1 _,𝑡_ +1∶ ⋮ _𝑡_ + _𝑇_ —
⎜⎝— **𝐳** _𝐷,𝑡_ +1∶ _𝑡_ + _𝑇_ —



⎞
⎟ ∈ ℝ _[𝐷]_ [×] _[𝑇]_ (3)
⎟⎠



The paper also considers so-called _covariates_, denoted by
**𝐱** _.,𝑡_ with support in ℝ _[𝐷]_ [′] . Thereby, for _𝑗_ ∈  [′] = {1 _, ..., 𝐷_ [′] },
_𝑥_ _𝑗,𝑡_ represents the observed value of the _𝑗_ -th covariate at
time _𝑡_, and the vector representation of all covariates at time
_𝑡_ is denoted by **𝐱** _.,𝑡_ = ( _𝑥_ 1 _,𝑡_ _, ..., 𝑥_ _𝐷_ ′ _,𝑡_ ). The corresponding
covariates in the paper include time encoding, e.g., day of
the week, and the weather-related quantities such as temperature, humidity, cloud coverage, wind speed, etc. Hence, the
matrix realization of the covariates is denoted as below:



**𝐱** ⋅ _,_  = ⎛⎜— **𝐱** 1 _,𝑡_ +1∶ ⋮ _𝑡_ + _𝑇_ —
⎜⎝— **𝐱** _𝐷_ ′ _,𝑡_ +1∶ _𝑡_ + _𝑇_ —



⎞
⎟ ∈ ℝ _[𝐷]_ [′] [×] _[𝑇]_ (4)
⎟⎠

**4. Multivariate Forecasting**


Let _𝑡_ ∈ ℤ and consider the forecasting horizon  =
{ _𝑡_ + 1 _, ..., 𝑡_ + _𝐻_ } of length _𝐻_, and the past observation
window of length _𝑊_ as  = { _𝑡_ − _𝑊_ +1 _, .., 𝑡_ −1 _, 𝑡_ }. A time
series forecasting model predicts the target **𝐳** _.,_  ∈ ℝ _[𝐷]_ [×] _[𝐻]_ as
**̂𝐳** _.,_  ∈ ℝ _[𝐷]_ [×] _[𝐻]_ . Figure 1(a) shows schematic of the DL-based
model for multivariate probabilistic forecasting of the wind



power generation given historical data and covariates. More
generally, probabilistic forecasting can be considered as
modeling the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the target variables conditioned on the past observations

Modeling this joint CDF directly is challenging due to the
high-dimensionality of the problems at hand. An alternative,
in the multivariate forecasting setting, is to jointly predict the
following marginal distributions:


_𝐹_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) = ℙ( _𝑍_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ≤ _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ∣ **𝐳** _.,_  _,_ **𝐱** _.,_  _,_ **𝐱** _.,_  ) _,_ (6)



where _𝑖_ ∈  is the spatial index indicating the location of the
target and _𝜏_ ∈  represents the time index within the forecasting horizon. In other words, the multivariate forecasting
model takes as input the historical data and covariates, which
are shared across different targets, and predicts the marginal
distributions. Then, given the estimated marginals as the
outputs of the multivariate forecasting, the next critical step
is to restore the spatial and temporal correlations among
the target variables. This is necessary for realistic scenario
generation, particularly within the RES where the targets
(e.g., electricity demand and outputs of multiple wind farms
or solar farms at different locations and time horizons) are
highly correlated. This paper restores the joint distribution
of the random variable **𝐙** _.,_  using a copula method, as
discussed in Section 5.


**5. Restoring Correlations via Copula**


The copula method provides a robust statistical tool
for modeling the underlying dependencies and correlations
in high-dimensional probabilistic forecasting. This method
enables the estimation of the joint distribution by combining
the marginal distributions with a copula function. In the context of RES, the copula method facilitates the generation of
realistic scenarios that accurately reflect the true variability
and spatial-temporal interdependencies.


**5.1. Copula Method**
A function **𝐂** ∶[0 _,_ 1] _[𝑑]_ → [0 _,_ 1] is a _copula_ if it
is the joint CDF of a _𝑑_ -dimensional random vector **𝐔** =
( _𝑈_ 1 _,_ … _, 𝑈_ _𝑑_ ) with uniformly distributed marginals on the
interval [0 _,_ 1]. Sklar’s Theorem (Sklar, 1959) shows that
any multivariate CDF can be expressed as the product of its
marginal distributions and a copula function.


**Theorem 1** (Sklar’s Theorem ) **.** _Let_ **𝐙** _be a 𝑑-dimensional_
_random variable with joint CDF_ **𝐅** **𝐙** _and marginal CDFs_
_𝐹_ _𝑍_ 1 _,_ … _, 𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑑_ _. There exists a copula_ **𝐂** _such that_


**𝐅** **𝐙** ( _𝑧_ 1 _, ..., 𝑧_ _𝑑_ ) = **𝐂** ( _𝐹_ _𝑍_ 1 ( _𝑧_ 1 ) _, ..., 𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑑_ ( _𝑧_ _𝑑_ )) _,_ (7)


_and the random variables 𝑈_ _𝑖_ = _𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑖_ ( _𝑍_ _𝑖_ ) _are uniformly_
_distributed on interval_ [0 _,_ 1] _(i.e., 𝑈_ _𝑖_ ∼  [0 _,_ 1] _). The copula_
**𝐂** _is unique, given continuous marginals 𝐹_ _𝑍_ 1 _,_ … _, 𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑑_ _._


Sklar’s theorem thus enables the decomposition of any
multivariate CDF into its marginal CDFs and a copula,
without specific assumptions on the marginals. Hence, given
the estimated marginal CDFs, it is possible, via a Copula
function, to reconstruct the joint CDF and represent the
underlying dependencies and correlations among different
dimensions. This is particularly crucial in probabilistic forecasting in RES where spatial and temporal correlations
should be restored in high dimensions.


**5.2. Conditional Copula**
Sklar’s theorem can be extended to modeling conditional
distributions, which is particularly important in regression



Hanyu Zhang et al.: _Preprint submitted to Elsevier_ Page 5 of 19


Probabilistic Forecasting and Scenario Generation



and time series forecasting (Patton, 2006, 2009). Given a
target random vector **𝐙** = ( _𝑍_ 1 _,_ … _, 𝑍_ _𝑑_ ) conditioned on a set
of input variables **𝐗**, the conditional copula aims at modeling
**𝐅** **𝐙** | **𝐗** from its marginals _𝐹_ _𝑍_ 1 | **𝐗** _,_ … _, 𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑑_ | **𝐗** as follows:


**𝐅** **𝐙** | **𝐗** = **𝐂** ( _𝐹_ _𝑍_ 1 | **𝐗** ( _𝑧_ 1 | **𝐱** ) _,_ … _, 𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑑_ | **𝐗** ( _𝑧_ _𝑑_ | **𝐱** )) (8)


It is important to note that, in general, the input variables **𝐗**
should be consistent across different marginals and the copula. For further details and considerations regarding different
input variable sets under specific assumptions, readers are
referred to (Fermanian and Wegkamp, 2012).


**5.3. Gaussian Copula**
One of the most popular and effective ways of linking
the joint distribution into its marginals is the Gaussian
copula. Considering Φ as the CDF of the standard normal
distribution and **𝚽** **𝐑** as the multivariate normal CDF with
mean vector of **𝟎** and covariance matrix of **𝐑**, the Gaussian
copula **𝐂** **𝐑** ∶[0 _,_ 1] _[𝑑]_ → [0 _,_ 1] is defined as:


**𝐂** **𝐑** = **𝚽** **𝐑** (Φ −1 ( _𝑢_ 1 ) _,_ … _,_ Φ −1 ( _𝑢_ _𝑑_ )) (9)


As a result, the multivariate joint CDF **𝐅** **𝐙** | **𝐗** can be decomposed as:


**𝐅** **𝐙** | **𝐗** =

**𝚽** **𝐑** (Φ [−1] [(] _𝐹_ _𝑍_ 1 | **𝐗** ( _𝑧_ 1 | **𝐱** ) [)] _,_ … _,_ Φ [−1] [(] _𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑑_ | **𝐗** ( _𝑧_ _𝑑_ | **𝐱** ) [))]

(10)


The two main pillars to estimate the joint CDF under the
Gaussian copula framework are: 1) the marginal CDFs _𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑖_ | **𝐗**
for _𝑖_ ∈{1 _,_ … _, 𝑑_ } and 2) the correlation matrix **𝐑** ∈ ℝ _[𝑑]_ [×] _[𝑑]_,
which is responsible for modeling the correlations among
different dimensions.
Figure 1(b) shows the schematic of the approach for
estimating the Gaussian copula for a 2D (i.e., _𝑑_ = 2)
problem. First, the marginal CDFs are estimated as _𝐹_ _[̂]_ _𝑍_ _𝑖_ | **𝐗**
using a probabilistic forecasting model and a training dataset
Ω train with _𝑁_ = |Ω train | samples. Then, given the training
covariate and target pairs (i.e., ( **𝐱** [(] _[𝑛]_ [)] _,_ **𝐳** [(] _[𝑛]_ [)] ) ∈Ω train _, 𝑛_ ∈
{1 _,_ … _, 𝑁_ }), and the estimated marginals _𝐹_ _[̂]_ _𝑍_ _𝑖_ | **𝐗**, each of the

target dimensions _𝑧_ [(] _𝑖_ _[𝑛]_ [)] is transformed into _𝑢_ [(] _𝑖_ _[𝑛]_ [)] = _̂𝐹_ _𝑍_ _𝑖_ | **𝐗** .

The transformed variables _𝑢_ [(] _𝑖_ _[𝑛]_ [)] are distributed uniformly on

[0 _,_ 1] if the underlying model that estimates marginals is
well-calibrated (refer to the probability integral transform
in the Appendix for more details). Following this step, the
corresponding data is transformed through the inverse of
the standard normal CDF to _𝑣_ [(] _𝑖_ _[𝑛]_ [)] = Φ [−1] ( _𝑢_ [(] _𝑖_ _[𝑛]_ [)] [)][. This results]
in a space with standard normal marginal CDFs. Finally,
the correlation matrix is estimated as **𝐑** **[̂]**, using Pearson
correlation over **𝐯** [(] _[𝑛]_ [)] = ( _𝑣_ [(] 1 _[𝑛]_ [)] _[,]_ [ …] _[, 𝑣]_ [(] _𝑑_ _[𝑛]_ [)] [)] _[, 𝑛]_ [∈{1] _[,]_ [ …] _[, 𝑁]_ [}][.]
The estimated correlation matrix is then used along with
the estimated marginals to form the Gaussian copula as
presented in Equation (10). In short, given a dataset with
dimension _𝑑_ × _𝑁_, where _𝑑_ corresponds to the dimension



**5.4. Scenario Generation**

The combination of the multivariate probabilistic forecasting and copula method provides the estimated joint
distribution of the target variables, incorporating the correlations among different dimensions. Consequently, it is possible to generate probabilistic scenarios by sampling from
the estimated joint distribution that captures the underlying
correlations between different dimensions.
The scenario generation steps are outlined in Algorithm
1 and are depicted in Figure 1(c) for a 2D (i.e., _𝑑_ = 2) example. The algorithm takes as input the estimated correlation
matrix **𝐑** **[̂]**, the estimated marginals _𝐹_ _[̂]_ _𝑍_ _𝑖_ | **𝐗** for _𝑖_ ∈{1 _,_ … _, 𝑑_ },
and the number of required scenarios (i.e., the number of
samples from the joint distribution) _𝑆_, and it outputs **̂𝐳** [(] _[𝑠]_ [)] =
( _̂𝑧_ [(] 1 _[𝑠]_ [)] _[,]_ [ …] _[, ̂𝑧]_ _𝑑_ [(] _[𝑠]_ [)] [)][ for] _[ 𝑠]_ [∈{1] _[, ..., 𝑆]_ [}][. The algorithm starts by]

sampling **𝐯** [(] _[𝑠]_ [)] = ( _𝑣_ [(] 1 _[𝑠]_ [)] _[,]_ [ …] _[, 𝑣]_ _𝑑_ [(] _[𝑠]_ [)] [)][ from a multivariate normal]
distribution with **𝟎** mean and estimated covariance matrix
**̂𝐑** (i.e.,  ( **𝟎** _,_ **̂𝐑** )). The samples are then transformed
using the CDF of the standard normal into _𝑢_ [(] _𝑖_ _[𝑠]_ [)] = Φ( _𝑣_ [(] _𝑖_ _[𝑠]_ [)] [)][,]
which has uniform marginals (as shown in Figure 1(c)).
Finally, the samples are mapped into the original space via
_̂𝑧_ [(] _[𝑠]_ [)] = _̂𝐹_ [−1]
_𝑖_ _𝑍_ _𝑖_ | **𝐗** [(] _[𝑢]_ _𝑖_ [(] _[𝑠]_ [)] [)][. The resulting vector] **[ ̂𝐳]** [(] _[𝑠]_ [)] [ corresponds]
to the samples generated using the copula method, which
captures the interdependencies and correlations among the
different dimensions.


**5.5. Copula for Time Series Scenario Generation**
This section extends the Gaussian copula method to
the context of time series forecasting in RES, where the
objective is to model a joint CDF for all sites and time steps,
and generate scenarios that capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies across the forecasting horizon. In this setting,
the joint conditional CDF **𝐅**  ( **𝐳** _.,_  ) is over _𝑑_ = _𝐷_ × _𝐻_

dimensions (recall that _𝐷_ = || is the number of locations
and _𝐻_ = || is the number of time steps in the forecast
horizon). Similar to what is presented in Section 5.3, the
joint conditional CDF can be derived from: 1) the estimated
conditional marginals _𝐹_ _[̂]_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) (where _𝑖_ ∈  and _𝜏_ ∈
) and 2) a Gaussian copula with an estimated correlation
matrix **𝐑** **[̂]** ∈ ℝ [(] _[𝐷]_ [×] _[𝐻]_ [)×(] _[𝐷]_ [×] _[𝐻]_ [)] that captures the spatio-temporal
correlations as follows:


**̂𝐅**  ( **𝐳** _.,_  ) = **𝚽** **̂𝐑** (Φ [−1] [(] _[ ̂]_ _𝐹_ 1 _,𝑡_ +1 ( _𝑧_ 1 _,𝑡_ +1 ) [)] _,_ … _,_ Φ [−1] [(] _𝐹_ _[ ̂]_ 1 _,𝑡_ + _𝐻_ ( _𝑧_ 1 _,𝑡_ + _𝐻_ ) [)] _,_

Note that **𝐅** **[̂]**  and _𝐹_ _[̂]_ _𝑖,𝜏_ (defined in (5) and (6), respectively)
are conditioned on the inputs **𝐳** _.,_ , **𝐱** _.,_ , and **𝐱** _.,_ , which are
omitted in Equation (12) for simplicity. Also, _𝜏_ depends on
_𝑡_, which corresponds to the starting of the forecasting time
window. The marginals are estimated using multivariate
probabilistic time series forecasting given a training dataset
and the corresponding covariates as:

where _𝑁_ is the total length of the training time series dataset
and _𝑡_ is the time index in the rolling time window.
Next, using the estimated marginal CDFs and following
the steps outlined in Section 5.3, the correlation matrix **𝐑** _[̂]_ ∈
ℝ [(] _[𝐷]_ [×] _[𝐻]_ [)×(] _[𝐷]_ [×] _[𝐻]_ [)] can be estimated using Pearson correlation,
with _𝑁_ [′] = _𝑁_ − _𝑊_ − _𝐻_ +1 samples (i.e., the training dataset
excluding the few first and last time steps).
The scenario generation follows the process outlined
in Section 5.4 and Algorithm 1. Samples are drawn from
 ( **𝟎** _,_ **𝐑** _[̂]_ ), producing _𝑆_ vectors with dimensions 1×( _𝐷_ ×
_𝐻_ ). Each sample is then reshaped into a matrix of size _𝐷_ × _𝐻_,
where the rows and the columns correspond to locations and
time, respectively.


**6. Experiment Setup**


A comprehensive performance evaluation was conducted
with large-scale data using various time series forecasting
methods. Both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting
methods are employed to assess their efficacy under different
metrics. Additionally, the experiments incorporate weather
information to evaluate its importance in predicting RES.
The forecast horizon  is set to 48 hours, which aligns with
the common practice for day-ahead market-clearing and reliability assessment in power systems (Werho, Zhang, Vittal,
Chen, Thatte and Zhao, 2021). However, the methodology
can be extended to longer or shorter time horizons depending
on the specific requirements.



**Table 2**

Dataset Summary: This table presents the overall minimum
and maximum values across all time series. For wind and

solar, the maximum values represent the capacity of the largest
wind or solar farms. For the load time series, which does
not have a predefined capacity, the capacity is defined by the
highest observation in the training dataset. The minimum value
for each type corresponds to the lowest recorded observation
across all time series.


Type _𝐷_ Level Total(GW) Min (MW) Max (MW)
load 6 zone 124.2 9424.6 32148.5

wind 286 unit 21.4 0.6 495.0

solar 376 unit 1.8 0.2 138.0


**6.1. Dataset**

Table 2 provides summary statistics of the MISO dataset
that is used in this study which contains time series data
for the years 2018 and 2019 with hourly resolution within
the MISO system (Sergi, Feng, Zhang, Hodge, Ring-Jarvi,
Bryce, Doubleday, Rose, Buster and Rossol, 2022). This
dataset includes zone-level time series for loads and unit
level time series of wind and solar power generation. Additionally, it includes forecasts generated by NREL’s System
Advisor Model (SAM) for the year 2019, which is considered for comparison with the developed models in this study.
To explore the effect of weather data, this study incorporates an additional dataset of weather forecasts for the
MISO system. The weather forecasts are gathered from the
publicly available datasets produced by the European Center
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), particularly from the THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) dataset (European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts, 2023; Varela Santolalla and Mladek,
2024). This dataset provides essential meteorological variables including surface pressure, wind speed, cloud cover,
skin temperature, solar irradiation, as outlined in Table 3.
Issued twice everyday at 12:00 and 00:00 UTC, the forecasts
from the TIGGE database are provided in 6-hour intervals
(Varela Santolalla and Mladek, 2024). The forecast data is
collected on a 1° latitude by 1° longitude grid covering the
MISO territory. The 6-hour temporal resolution time series
from the ECMWF are then interpolated to hourly granularity
to align with the load, and wind and solar power time series
data used in this study.


**6.2. Methods**
In this study, different methods are employed to determine their efficacy for 48-hour forecasting horizon prediction in RES and load. The models encompass both traditional
statistical methods and advanced DL-based techniques with
and without incorporation of weather data, to provide a comprehensive performance comparison. The models include:


  - ARIMA: This model is implemented in a univariate
framework due to the shortcoming of the autoregresive methods in handling high-dimensional input data
(Ho and Xie, 1998).



Hanyu Zhang et al.: _Preprint submitted to Elsevier_ Page 7 of 19


Probabilistic Forecasting and Scenario Generation


**Table 3**
Description of Meteorological Variables (Varela Santolalla and Mladek, 2024).


Variable Description
10u - Eastward component of the 10 metre wind ( _U-component_ ): Measures the horizontal speed of air moving towards
the east at a height of ten metres above the Earth’s surface, in metres per second.
10v - Northward component of the 10 metre wind ( _V-component_ ): Measures the horizontal speed of air moving towards
the north at a height of ten metres above the Earth’s surface, in metres per second.
2t  - 2 metre temperature: Temperature of the air measured at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, in kelvins (K).
skt  - Skin temperature: Temperature at the interface between the Earth and the atmosphere, in kelvins (K). Measured
directly at the Earth’s surface.
sp - Surface pressure: Atmospheric pressure exerted on the Earth’s surface by the air above, measured in pascals (Pa).
Reflects the weight of the air vertically above a point.
ssr  - Net surface solar radiation: Total solar radiation (shortwave radiation) reaching a horizontal plane at the Earth’s
surface, adjusted for the albedo, measured in joules per square metre (J/m [2] ).
tcc  - Total cloud cover: Proportion of the sky occluded by clouds, measured on a scale from 0 (no cover) to 1 (complete
cover).




  - Dlinear: This is a linear model tailored for time series

forecasting. The implementation in this work considers the spatio-temporal correlations by regressing the
forecasts over the previous observations and past and
future covariates (Zeng, Chen, Zhang and Xu, 2022).


  - Nlinear: This model normalizes each input by subtracting the last value in the sequence and then adds it
back after passing through the linear layer to address
distribution shift. In this paper, the model is adapted
to probabilistic setting by using quantile regression
objective function (Zeng et al., 2022).


  - DeepAR: This is an RNN-based model designed to
capture the temporal dependencies and provide multistep ahead forecast by recursively applying the model,
using its own predictions as inputs for subsequent
steps. In this work, the model’s output parameters
are parametrized using a Beta distribution to account
for the capacity factors in RES, which are inherently
bounded between 0 and 1 (Salinas et al., 2020).


  - TFT: This is a transformer-based model designed for
multi-horizon forecasting with mixed-type inputs, including static covariates, known future inputs, and
past exogenous time series. Quantile loss is utilized
for training the model in this work (Lim et al., 2021).


The models are trained using historical data of the targets
from 2018 within the MISO system, with the remaining data
reserved for testing. At the beginning of each month, a new
model is trained using all available observations since Jan.
1st, 2018 up to midnight on the first day of that month.
The first week of each month is designated for validation
purposes (i.e., for fine tuning the model parameters), and the
models are subsequently evaluated during the second week
of each month. The DL models are trained both with and

without weather data to assess the importance of weather
covariates. Evaluations are conducted only for the first nine
months, as the ECMWF data was not available from October

2019 onward.



Weather features are utilized as additional covariates

in the forecasting tasks for the WI-based models. These
covariates include both historical weather data and weather

forecasts, which are available in advance as discussed in the
previous section. For each target variable, weather information from the closest region on a 1° by 1° grid is used. For
load forecasting, skin temperature and total cloud cover are
incorporated as key variables. For wind power generation
forecasting, the model uses wind speed, surface pressure,
and both V and U wind components, which indicate horizontal airflow towards the north and east, respectively. In
forecasting solar power generation, total cloud cover and
surface solar radiation are key variables. When generating
forecasts, the actual weather information from the past and
weather forecasts for the upcoming forecasting horizon are
fed into the WI-based models..

The ARIMA model parameters are optimized using the
open-source Statsforecasts package (NIXTLA, 2024), which
features an AutoARIMA function for parameter selection.
Training of the DL-based models are performed in Pytorch
using Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Early stopping with patience of 10 steps in conjunction with a learning
rate scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau) with patience of 5
steps is used for all models. The remaining hyperparameters
for each model are optimized using Optuna (Akiba, Sano,
Yanase, Ohta and Koyama, 2019). The details about the
training process are provided in C.


**6.3. Evaluation Metrics**

This section outlines various metrics employed to quantify the models for both deterministic and the probabilistic
forecasting (i.e., scenario generation). Recall that, for a given
target _𝑖_ ∈  and each time step within the forecasting time
horizon ( _𝜏_ ∈ ), the model produces output in the form
of marginal CDFs, whereas _𝑆_ forecasts (i.e., scenarios) are
generated for the scenario generation using Algorithm 1.
This essentially gives the prediction one more dimension,
which indiced by superscript ( _𝑠_ ).
The evaluation of the deterministic forecasts are performed at the individual and space-sum levels. Additionally,

generation over unseen test data across the different models
discussed in Section 6.2, with and without the inclusion of

the weather covariates.
To evaluate the efficacy of the models and the significance of integrating the copula method for realistic scenario
generation, the results report the energy distance (ED) and
variogram score (VS). ED is a proper scoring rule that measures the distance between the predicted CDF and the actual
observations. It generalizes the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and is particularly useful for vector-valued
forecasts in high-dimensional spaces (Gneiting and Raftery,
2007). This paper considers ED due to its generalization
capabilities for high-dimensional data. However, in scenario
generation, both ED and CRPS fail to detect differences
in correlation structures (Bjerregård, Møller and Madsen,
2021). Therefore, VS is introduced to quantify differences
between the correlations of the scenarios and the ground
truth. More details regarding the metrics are presented in A
in the Appendix.

the probabilistic forecasts metrics are computed over timesum levels to quantify the ability of the models in capturing

Following this, the probabilistic forecasting results are discussed, highlighting the rational for incorporating the copula
technique to restore the correlations. The experimental results are reported on distinct individual and aggregate levels.


**7.1. Deterministic Prediction**
To evaluate the performance of the different models discussed in Section 6.2 for point-predictions and quantify the
importance of weather covariates, deterministic forecasts are
performed for each model. For each probabilistic forecasting
method, and given the predicted marginal distributions of
each space-time dimension, the expected values on each
dimension are used as deterministic forecasts. For models

that trained with quantile loss, the middle quantiles are used
as deterministic forecasts, as they are optimized for L1 loss
(Koenker and Hallock, 2001; Wen et al., 2017). The forecasting accuracy of each model is evaluated using NMAE ind



~~and RMSE~~ ~~ind~~ ~~to measure~~ the average forecast accuracy
~~across all individual series.~~ Additionally, NMAE s-sum and
RMSE s-sum are used to assess the forecasts for total load,
and solar and wind power generation at the aggregate space

pact of weather covariates. The models that utilize weather
data are denoted with the prefix _WI_ (i.e., weather informed)
in Table 5.

The comparison of deterministic forecasting methods
shows how the DL-based models improve over the traditional ARIMA model. These improvements are primarily
attributed to the transition from ARIMA’s univariate frame
work to a DL-based multivariate approach, which more
accurately captures the complex dynamics within energy
systems. The capacity of these models to effectively utilize cross-series information significantly enriches the forecasting process, offering a deeper understanding of energy
patterns. The integration of weather forecast information
into these models further enhances their accuracy. It is
observed that WI models consistently outperform those that
do not include weather data, highlighting the importance of
weather covariates in predicting the variability of RES. This

is most pronounced in the TFT model, where incorporating
weather covariates yields a significant reduction in prediction error by 49% for load forecasting, 40% for wind energy
prediction, and 34% for solar energy prediction on NMAE
at an individual asset level. Similarly, adding covariantes
improves RMSE at individual asset level by 30% to 50%.
Moreover, the advantage of incorporating weather features becomes increasingly apparent for forecasts that extend
further into the future, as depicted in Figure 2. This trend is
especially notable in wind energy forecasting: while models
exhibit comparable accuracy for the initial 5-hour period,
the performance of WI models remains robust beyond this
window. In contrast, models lacking weather data experience
a significant decline in performance over time. This pattern
suggests that short-term predictions primarily rely on the
current state of the system, whereas the accuracy of extended
forecasts is increasingly contingent upon reliable weather information. A notable limitation of the linear models, such as
DLinear and NLinear, is their inability to cope with the daily
seasonality present in the data, which presents as a periodic
pattern in the errors for load and solar power forecasting, as
shown in Figure 2. Conversely, the WI-TFT model maintains
consistent performance across different targets and various
lead times, highlighting its superiority in reliable forecasting
for RES.

The NREL dataset also comes with predictions (Sergi
et al., 2022). Therefore, a comparison of prediction accuracy is made between the results of this paper and NREL.
Every effort has been made to ensure a fair comparison.
However, it should be noted that NREL forecasts have an
11-hour lead time and are updated once a day. In contrast,
the forecasts in this paper are updated hourly without a
lead time. This difference means that Table 5 contains 24
times more samples than the NREL forecasts. In the realm
of load prediction, NREL forecasts exhibit a NMAE of
2.3% and a RMSE of 3708.0 at the aggregate level, and a
NMAE of 3.3% alongside a RMSE of 885.6 at the individual



level. The WI-TFT model for load prediction demonstrates
a notable 52% improvement in NMAE at the aggregate level
and a 4.4% improvement at the individual level over NREL
predictions. When evaluating wind power predictions, the
WI-TFT and NREL models show comparable performance
at the individual level, with NREL registering a RMSE of
16.9. However, at the aggregate level, the WI-TFT model
achieves a 44% better NMAE than the 11.4%from NREL.

For solar power predictions, the WI-TFT model performs
70% worse at the individual level and 94% worse at the

aggregate level in terms of NMAE compared to NREL.
Despite this, both models exhibit high accuracy regarding
the magnitude of errors, as evidenced in Table 5, with the
WI-TFT model averaging only a 0.5 MW error per generator
based on RMSE at individual level.


**7.2. Scenario Generation**

This section presents the results for the probabilistic
forecasting of RES using the DL-based WI models discussed in the previous sections. Models that do not include
weather covariates are omitted, as it was demonstrated that
they consistently underperform compared to the WI models.
Specifically, the performance of the generated scenarios
for load, wind power, and solar power generation using
different models are compared with and without integration
of Gaussian copula. The evaluation metrics are computed for
scenarios generated from both marginal distributions (mar.)
and joint distributions represented by copula (cop.). For each
model and individual target, 200 scenarios are generated
(i.e., _𝑆_ = 200) with and without the copula restoration.
The performance of the models for generating scenarios are
presented in Table 6.
The ED quantifies the distance between the distributions of the forecasted scenarios and the actual data. Lower

ED values with the copula indicate improved alignment
of generated scenarios with the true distribution. The ED
for joint distribution and ( s-sum )-level are calculated and

presented in Table 6. Notably, as the sample sizes remain

identify the equality of means and the traces of covariance

solar power generation with an improvement from 2% to
20% across different models.
The VS evaluates the correlation structure within the

forecast scenarios. Due to the computational expense of
VS for large dimensions, VS s-sum and VS t-sum are computed
to capture the correlations across the spatial and temporal
dimensions, respectively. The VS values are reduced by
0 _._ 4% to 5% upon integration of the copula, demonstrating its
ability in improving the spatial and temporal correlations.
The WI-TFT model performs the best overall due to
its superior ED and sufficiently low VS values. The lower
ED indicates that the scenarios generated by WI-TFT are
more accurate and closer to the true distribution, which is
crucial for effective forecasting and decision making. It is
important to note that VS does not capture the accuracy
of the prediction and ED is more critical than VS in this
context. Hence, ED and VS should be considered together
for a comprehensive assessment of both the accuracy and
reliability of the generated scenarios.
Figure 3 illustrates the comparative scenario analysis
confirmed by the statistical data in Table 6. The left side
of each plot displays various characteristics of scenarios
generated from marginal distributions, while the right side
depicts these characteristics after incorporating estimated
correlations via the copula method. At the top of the figure,
the plots 3a and 3e provide a 48-hour prediction for one load
zone at the individual ( ind )-level. The coverage of the scenarios remains consistent before and after the application of
the copula. However, the copula-generated scenarios exhibit
smoother temporal correlations, aligning more closely with
the ground truth. This smoother correlation is particularly
evident in the Figures 3b and 3f, which shows the ramp rates
of these scenarios. Here, the ramps of the copula models
closely match the actual ramps, whereas those derived from
marginal distributions show significant deviations.
Figures 3g, 3c, 3d, and 3h illustrate the same instance but
at the space-sum ( s-sum )-level. Initially, the copula scenarios
display wider coverage compared to the marginal scenarios, effectively capturing some essential spatial correlations.
This enhanced coverage ensures that the copula scenarios
more accurately encompass the actual total-level outputs.
Similar to the ( ind )-level, the temporal correlations at the
( s-sum )-level are more accurately represented in the copula



scenarios, as demonstrated by the improved ramp alignment
in the final row of the figure.
The conclusions drawn from the load scenarios apply
similarly to wind and solar. Figure 4 shows the effectiveness
of WI-TFT with copula in generating realistic scenarios for
individual load zones, wind farms, and solar farms. The
copula method improves temporal and spatial correlations,
better aligning the generated scenarios with the actual data
compared to marginal distributions alone.


**8. Conclusion**


This paper proposed a new method based on combination of TFT and Gaussian copula for high-dimensional probabilistic forecasting in RES. Extensive experiments were
conducted to compare different time series forecasting methods on a real-world forecasting problem within the MISO
system. The results demonstrated superiority of the TFT
model compared to other statistical and DL-based methods,
and the significant impact of including weather information
on the accuracy and effectiveness of the forecasts. The
integration of weather data as covariates also improved the
precision of the models over higher lead times. Additionally,
the paper highlighted the efficacy of the Gaussian copula
method in restoring spatio-temporal correlations, which is
crucial for generating realistic scenarios in RES forecasting.
This methodological advancement provides a robust framework for addressing the complexities associated with highdimensional forecasting problems in RES.
Future work will focus on studying the effect of noise in
covariates on the performance of the forecasts and scenarios.
Investigating how inaccuracies in weather data influence
the model’s predictions is essential for further improving
the robustness of the forecasting method. Additionally, uncertainty quantification will be considered using conformal
prediction to provide confidence-aware predictions in highdimensional RES forecasting problems. This will involve
developing techniques to quantify and incorporate prediction
uncertainty, thereby offering more reliable and actionable
insights for system operators.

**A. Evaluation Metrics**


In this section, the details of evaluation metrics are
provided.


**A.1. Deterministic Forecast**

In the case of point forecast, _𝑆_ = 1 and only one
scenario/forecast is generated. For notational simplicity, the
scenario index _𝑠_ is dropped in this subsection.


_Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE)_ For wind
and solar power, the ground truth can sometimes become



zero or close to zero. To avoid dividing by zeros, NMAE is
considered. The first metric considers the forecast on each
space-time dimension:



_,_ (13)

_̂𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ − _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_
max{ **𝐳** _𝑖,_  train }



expressed as a percentage. The NMAE ind reflects the average
performance on individual time series.
The normalization value _𝑧_ max{ **𝐳** _𝑖,_  } is the capacity of the
generator if given. If the capacity is not given, it is the
maximum value of the first year in the training dataset.
The second metric considers summation over space and
is defined as:



_𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_
_𝑖_ =1



_𝐷_ _𝐷_

_Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)_ The RMSE is a commonly used metric to measure the accuracy of a model by
calculating the square root of the average squared differences
between the predicted and actual values. It provides a measure of the average magnitude of the error. The first metric
considers the forecast on each space-time dimension:



∑

_𝑖_ ∈ _,𝜏_ ∈

also expressed in MW. The RMSE s-sum measures the model’s
accuracy in predicting the summation of wind power, solar
power, or load over space.


**A.2. Probabilistic Forecast**

_Energy Distance_ The energy distance is a popular metric
for evaluating the quality of probabilistic forecasts (Messner,
Pinson, Browell, Bjerregård and Schicker, 2020). Given two
probability distributions  and  with support in ℝ _[𝐷]_, the
energy distance between  and  is defined as


ED( _,_ ) = 2𝔼 ‖ _𝑋_ − _𝑌_ ‖−𝔼 [‖] ‖ _𝑋_ − _𝑋_ [′] [‖] ‖−𝔼 [‖] ‖ _𝑌_ − _𝑌_ [′] [‖] ‖ _,_ (17)


where ‖ ⋅ ‖ is the Euclidean norm, and _𝑋_ ∼  _, 𝑋_ [′] ∼  _, 𝑌_ ∼
 _, 𝑌_ [′] ∼  are independent random variables. In particular,
when  and  are empirical probability distributions with

realizations **𝐱** = { _𝑥_ 1 _, ..., 𝑥_ _𝑛_ } and **𝐲** = { _𝑦_ 1 _, ..., 𝑦_ _𝑚_ }, an
estimator of the energy distance using the U-statistics is
given by:



_Variogram Score_ The variogram score (VS) captures the
correlations among multivariate quantities (Scheuerer and
Hamill, 2015). Given a probabilistic forecast at time _𝑡_, the
corresponding variogram score of order _𝑝_ is defined as



_𝑚_
∑ ‖ _𝑥_ _𝑖_ − _𝑦_ _𝑗_ ‖

_𝑗_ =1



VS _𝑝_ ( _𝑡_ ) =



ED _̂_ ( **𝐱** _,_ **𝐲** ) = [2]

∑

_𝑖_ =1



_𝑆_
∑

_𝑠_ =1



(18)


Note that, for _𝑚_ = 1 case, the third term in the above

summation is zero.

Here, two energy distance metrics are considered: (i)
At time step _𝑡_, the _𝐷_ -by- _𝑇_ matrix _𝑧_ ⋅ _,_  is vectorized by
stacking the columns of the matrix on top of one another. The
resulting _𝐷𝑇_ -dimensional vector is denoted by vec( _𝑧_ ⋅ _,_  ).
There arequality of those forecasts are measured by _𝑆_ generated forecasts, _̂𝑧_ [(] ⋅ _,_ _[𝑠]_  [)] _[, 𝑠]_ [= 1] _[,]_ [ …] _[, 𝑆]_ [and the]


ED _̂_ (vec( _𝑧_ ⋅ _,_  ) _,_ {vec( _̂𝑧_ ⋅ _,_  ) [(] _[𝑠]_ [)] _, 𝑠_ = 1 _,_ … _, 𝑆_ })



In all the experiments that follow, the variogram score is
evaluated with _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 5, following the recommendations in
Scheuerer and Hamill (2015).
As can be seen from Eq (20), computing the variogram
score for one time period has complexity ( _𝐷_ [2] _𝑇_ [2] _𝑆_ ). This
is computationally intractable for high dimensional setting,
where _𝐷_ ≥ 300, _𝑇_ = 48, and _𝑆_ = 200 for two days
ahead solar power forecast. Therefore, variogram scores are
reported for summation of load and renewable generation
predictions over space. This captures temporal correlations
(between time periods), at the expense of spatial correlations
(between time series).

Averaging over the test set, the average time-sum variogram score is given as

Recall that forecasts are produced for multiple time
series and time periods. Therefore, the energy distance in
Eq. (19) captures both the spatial and temporal quality of
the forecasts.

Probabilistic Forecasting and Scenario Generation



**A.3. Marginal Distributions**
When estimating marginal distributions, researchers
typically employ either parametric or non-parametric approaches. This section introduces two prevalent methods:
quantile regression and parameterized distribution estimation.


_Non-Parametric Estimation: Quantile Regression_ The
quantile regression approach, as outlined in Wen et al.(Wen
et al., 2017), utilizes the concept of quantile loss in multistep
multivariate settings. Consider  to represent a predefined
set of quantiles. For any given target quantity in space-time,
denoted by _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_, our model generates a corresponding set
of quantile estimates _̂𝑧_ [(] _𝑖,𝜏_ _[𝑞]_ [)] [, where] _[ 𝑞]_ [∈] [][. The primary goal]
is to minimize the overall quantile loss function across all
estimated quantiles, _̂𝑧_ [(] _𝑖,𝜏_ _[𝑞]_ [)] [, formulated as follows:]



Optimization is typically performed on the log-likelihood,



∑

_𝜏_ ∈



∑[( _𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ −1) ln( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) + ( _𝛽_ _𝑖,𝜏_ −1) ln(1 − _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ )]

_𝑖_ ∈



max
_𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _,𝛽_ _𝑖,𝜏_



∑

_𝑡_



min ∑

_𝑡_



∑

_𝜏_ ∈



∑

_𝑞_ ∈



∑ QL _𝑞_ ( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _, ̂𝑧_ [(] _𝑖,𝜏_ _[𝑞]_ [)] ) _,_

_𝑖_ ∈



where _𝑡_ iterates over all forecast creation times.
The quantile loss (QL) is defined as


QL _𝑞_ ( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _, ̂𝑧_ [(] _𝑖,𝜏_ _[𝑞]_ [)] )

+ + (25)
= _𝑞_ ( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ − _̂𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ [(] _[𝑞]_ [)] ) + (1 − _𝑞_ ) ( _̂𝑧_ [(] _𝑖,𝜏_ _[𝑞]_ [)] [−] _[𝑧]_ _[𝑖,𝜏]_ ) _,_


where (⋅) [+] = max(0 _,_ ⋅). This paper considers the quantiles
_𝑞_ ∈{0 _._ 1 _,_ 0 _._ 3 _,_ 0 _._ 5 _,_ 0 _._ 7 _,_ 0 _._ 9}.
Once the quantiles _̂𝑧_ [(] _𝑖,𝜏_ _[𝑞]_ [)] [are available, the CDF function]
_̂𝐹_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) can be estimated from fitting a smooth curve across
the predicted quantiles.


_Parametric Estimation: Maximum Likelihood Estima-_
_tion (MLE)_ The Beta MLE approach is utilized for estimating the parameters of a Beta distribution, typically denoted
as _𝛼_ (alpha) and _𝛽_ (beta). This method is particularly beneficial when the data is understood to follow a Beta distribution,
often applicable to variables constrained between 0 and 1.
For RES, it is common to scale the time series based on
their capacity to capacity factors, therefore, beta distribution
is chosen to demonstrate the parametric estimation.
For a set of observations _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ corresponding to each
forecast time _𝜏_ within the forecast horizon  and across all

dimensions _𝑖_ ∈ , assuming these observations are drawn
from a Beta distribution, the aim of Beta MLE is to find the
parameter values that maximize the likelihood of the given
sample.
The likelihood function for the Beta distribution, given
the observations, is:



∏

_𝜏_ ∈



∏

_𝑖_ ∈



_𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ −1
_𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ (1 − _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) _[𝛽]_ _[𝑖,𝜏]_ [−1]

_𝐵_ ( _𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _, 𝛽_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) _,_



max
_𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _,𝛽_ _𝑖,𝜏_



∏

_𝑡_



where _𝑡_ iterates all forecast creation times and _𝐵_ ( _𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _, 𝛽_ _𝑖,𝜏_ )
is the Beta function.



− _𝐷𝐻_ ln( _𝐵_ ( _𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _, 𝛽_ _𝑖,𝜏_ )) _._
(26)


The _̂𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ and _𝛽_ _[̂]_ _𝑖,𝜏_ are found using gradient decent. Then
the estimated marginal CDF functions can be written as
_̂𝐹_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ( _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) = _𝐼_ _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ( _𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _𝛽_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) where _𝐼_ _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ( _𝛼_ _𝑖,𝜏_ _𝛽_ _𝑖,𝜏_ ) is the regularized incomplete beta function.


**B. Baseline Models**


**B.1. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average**
**(ARIMA)**
The ARIMA model is a popular and widely used statistical method for time series forecasting. It combines the concepts of autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving
average (MA) models to forecast future values based on past
values. The AR component considers the linear relationship
between an observation and a certain number of lagged observations. The I component involves differencing the series
to make it stationary, removing trends or seasonality that
can affect the model. However, the non-stationarity can be
sometimes caused by a non-structured dynamic background
(Wei, Xie and Rahnev, 2021); The method proposed therein
can only handle time series retrospectively, and fails to
forecast the dynamic background. The unstructured nonstationarity is out of the scope of the current work and is
left for future discussion. The MA component accounts for
the linear dependency between an observation and a residual
error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

The ARIMA model is a univariate model. The multi
varite extention of ARIMA model is the Vector Autore
gressive Integrated Moving Average (VARIMA) model.
VARIMA models capture the dependencies between the
lagged values of all the variables in the system. However,
in the high-dimensional time series problem. The VARIMA
model is unsuitable in practice because of the number
of parameters in the linear model. Therefore, each time
series is modeled independently using ARIMA model using the existing Auto-ARIMA package (Garza, Mergenthaler Canseco, Challú and G. Olivares, 2022).


**B.2. DeepAR**
DeepAR model is a deep learning-based approach that
uses RNNs to capture temporal dependencies and can handle
multiple related time series together. Similar to ARIMA
model, DeepAR deals with multi-step ahead forecast by
applying the model recursively, utilizing its own predictions
as inputs for future predictions. As shown in Figure 5, the
model takes observations prior to time _𝑡_ as input, and its
predictions for the prediction horizon starting at time _𝑡_ are
used as inputs for the model at the next time step. The

_𝐵_ ( _𝛼, 𝛽_ ) = [Γ][(] _[𝛼]_ [)][Γ][(] _[𝛽]_ [)] (29)

Γ( _𝛼_ + _𝛽_ ) _[,]_


and Γ(⋅) is the Gamma function. In this beta distribution
example, at time _𝑡_, the model estimation can be done by
maximizing the log-likelihood as follows:



∑ log 𝓁 ( _𝑧_ [(] _𝑖,𝜏_ _[𝑡]_ [)] [;] _[ 𝛼]_ _𝑖,𝜏_ [(] _[𝑡]_ [)] _[, 𝛽]_ _𝑖,𝜏_ [(] _[𝑡]_ [)] ) _,_

model’s outputs are the parameters of a beta distribution,
_𝛼_ and _𝛽_, rather than a Gaussian distribution as used in the
original paper. This is because the DeepAR model outputs
capacity factors of RES that are bounded between 0 and 1,
making the Gaussian distribution unsuitable.
To estimate the model likelihood, the joint conditional
distribution of _𝑍_ ⋅ _,_  can be decomposed into a product of
marginal conditional probabilistic distributions via Bayes

**B.3. NLinear and DLinear**


**Figure 6:** Linear Model


The NLinear and Dlinear models are variants of the

model described in Zeng et al. (2022). The original paper
does not consider the spatial correlations and covariates.
And the weights are shared for every time series. To account
for covariates (weather forecast), every future dimension in
space and time is regressed on features of all past observations for all time series as well as covariates that extends to

future.

Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the models
inputs and outputs for a vanilla linear (one-layer) model.
Dlinear and Nlinear correspond to two preprocessing methods build upon the vanilla linear model. Dlinear uses decomposition scheme, which decomposes the input into trend
and seasonal component. NLinear normalizes each input by
subtracting the last value in the sequence, and then adds
it back after passing through the linear layer to address
distribution shift. Initially, the models were only used for
point predictions. However, in this paper, it is adapted to
a probabilistic setting by using quantile regression as the
objective function, as described in the TFT (Lim et al., 2021)
model.


**B.4. Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**
TFT is a deep learning model designed for multi-horizon
forecasting tasks with mixed-type inputs, including static
covariates, known future inputs, and past exogenous time
series. TFT uses a combination of recurrent layers and selfattention layers to learn temporal relationships at different
scales and provide interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. The model utilizes specialized components to select
relevant features and gating layers to suppress unnecessary

) = 𝓁 ( _𝑧_ [(] _𝑖,𝜏_ _[𝑡]_ [)] [∣] _[𝜃]_ [(] **[𝐡]** [(] _𝑖,𝑡_ _[𝑡]_ [)] [; Θ)] ) _,_



where the likelihood 𝓁(⋅) is parameterized by _𝜃_, where _𝜃_
depends on trainable parameter Θ and the output **𝐡** [(] _𝑖,𝑡_ _[𝑡]_ [)] [of an]
autoregressive RNN:


**𝐡** [(] _𝑖,𝑡_ _[𝑠]_ [)] [=] _[ ℎ]_ ( **𝐡** _𝑖,𝑡_ [(] _[𝑡]_ [)] −1 _[,]_ **[ 𝐳]** ⋅ [(] _,_ _[𝑡]_  [)] _[,]_ **[ 𝐳]** ⋅ [(] _,_ _[𝑡]_  [)] _[,]_ **[ 𝐱]** ⋅ [(] _,_ _[𝑡]_  [)] [; Θ] ) _,_ (28)


and _ℎ_ (⋅) is a multi-layer RNN with LSTM cells. Here,
Θ are typically associated with the neural network model
architecture. This model is autoregressive in the sense that
it exploits the observation at the last step _𝑧_ _𝑖,𝑡_ −1 and the
previous output of the network **𝐡** [(] _𝑖,𝑡_ _[𝑡]_ [)] −1 [as an input at the next]
time step.
In our work, because the amount of electricity generated
by the wind farm is capped by the wind power capacity
per wind farm, by normalizing with respect to the wind
power capacity, the historical wind power time series can
be represented within the range of [0 _,_ 1]. Thus, the beta
distribution for the target parametric distribution is more
suitable. The likelihood of the beta distribution reads


𝓁( _𝑧_ ; _𝛼, 𝛽_ ) = _[𝑧]_ _[𝛼]_ [−1] [(][1 −] _[𝑧]_ [)] _[𝛽]_ [−1] _,_

quantiles produced by the TFT model.


**C. Training Process**


The models were trained using the Adam optimizer, and
a learning rate scheduler was employed to adaptively adjust
the learning rate during training. Specifically, we utilized the
ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler with a reduction factor of 0.1, a
threshold of 0.0001, a patience of 5 epochs, and a minimum
learning rate of lr × 10 [−4] . Early stopping criteria were also
implemented based on the validation loss, with a patience
of 10 epochs and a minimum delta of 0.0001 to prevent
overfitting. The detailed configurations of each model are
provided in Table 7. All experiments were conducted on a
