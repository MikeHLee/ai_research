~~**Abstract**~~


This paper details an outlook on modern constraint programming (CP) education through the
lens of a CP instructor. A general overview of current CP courses and instructional methods is
presented, with a focus on online and virtually-delivered courses. This is followed by a discussion of
the novel approach taken to introductory CP education for engineering students at large scale at
the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, GA, USA. The paper summarizes
important takeaways from the Georgia Tech CP course and ends with a discussion on the future
of CP education. Some ideas for instructional methods, promotional methods, and organizational
changes are proposed to aid in the long-term growth of CP education.

**1** **Introduction and Current CP Education**


Constraint programming (CP) is a methodology for solving combinatorial problems to find
feasible or optimal solutions by using constraints to reduce the set of values each variable
in a problem can potentially take. The field lies at the intersection of operations research
and computer science and drives numerous applications in the real world, such as hospital
scheduling, sports tournament bracketing, delivery vehicle routing, and evacuation planning.
In general, CP education at the university level tends to be fairly decentralized. Unlike
the abundance of machine learning courses, for example, that one can find at almost every
university today, existence of CP courses is largely predicated on having qualified and
motivated CP practitioners willing to design or teach such a course. For many years, quality
CP education was largely limited to graduate students who were fortunate enough to work
in departments that offered CP courses. Christine Solnon led an online artificial intelligence
(AI) course for graduate students in France in the early 2000s that contained 12 hours worth
of sessions on Gnu-Prolog and CP. The course focused on the basics of CP modeling and CP
solvers while working to solve puzzles like map coloring and “SEND + MORE = MONEY”

[ 12 ]. Helmut Simonis started, and still runs, an online course teaching ECLiPSE in order to
learn CP modeling and solving techniques. Today, one may self-study using the videos and
handouts on the course website [ 10, 11 ]. However, in the last decade, the advent of Massive
Open Online Courses (MOOCs) brought opportunities to democratize CP education in a
structured manner with lessons and assignments for members of the general public. Pascal
Van Hentenryck’s Discrete Optimization course on Coursera introduced some basics of CP
and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) with over 18 hours of interactive material comprising

Indiana Jones-themed videos, readings, and quizzes [ 13 ]. The course also featured the use of
an autograder system to grade the vast number of submissions from members of the general
public. Johannes Waldmann also developed an ‘autotool‘ autograder framework along with
some exercises focused on understanding the fundamental algorithms behind CP solvers [ 14 ].
More recently, Jimmy Lee and Peter Stuckey co-developed three Coursera MOOCs on the
subject of “Modeling and Solving Discrete Optimization Problems” [ 1, 5 ]. The courses feature
a form of problem-based learning encapsulated in a coherent story plot following classic
Chinese novels. Lee and Stuckey presented learner statistics and feedback, and discussed
their experience with adopting the online materials in a smaller flipped classroom setting
as well. In 2022, Hoffmann et al. produced the first human-centered study addressing how
people approach constraint modeling and solving [ 3 ]. This information will be useful in
pedagogical design for future CP courses. Pierre Schaus, Laurent Michel, and Pascal Van
Hentenryck launched a CP MOOC in February 2023 on edX using the Mini-CP solver, a
lightweight, open-source CP solver designed for educational purposes [ 6 ]. The Mini-CP solver
comes with a series of more than 20 implementation projects to help students with the basics
of CP modeling and search heuristics.

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic over the last few years have signaled a shift in
the way educational content is delivered and consumed. In order to continue growth as a
practice, the CP community must adapt to these new pedagogical styles. This paper draws
on the authors’ experiences from an online CP course at the Georgia Institute of Technology
(Georgia Tech) to detail lessons learned and novel strategies for introductory CP education.


**2** **The Georgia Tech CP Course**


The Georgia Tech CP Course was started in Fall 2018 by Pascal Van Hentenryck. The course
was initially taught as an in-person course and focused on using the OPL programming
language inside the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio to model CP problems. The
first third of the course focused on learning OPL and modeling puzzles with CP. The second
third of the course goes from modeling basic optimization toy problems to condensed versions
of real-world optimization problems. The last third of the course focused on CP applications
in scheduling, routing, and evacuation planning. The course was housed in the Industrial
and Systems Engineering department at Georgia Tech and was open to both advanced
undergraduate and graduate students within the department. The course primarily focused
on finite-domain CP as an approachable introduction within the College of Engineering. The
enrollment of this initial CP course offering was 26 students.

With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing instruction to be delivered online in 2020, Van
Hentenryck adapted the method of course delivery considerably in order to maintain effectiveness in a virtual format. This redevelopment modified the Georgia Tech CP course into the
form which it takes today. The size of the Georgia Tech CP course grew considerably after
this point. While the course was initially offered yearly in the Fall semesters, the frequency
was increased to both Fall and Spring semesters starting in Spring 2023. Also in Spring 2023,
Tejas Santanam joined the CP course as an instructor, having been a prior student and head
teaching assistant for the Georgia Tech CP course.


This is the only CP course offered at any level at Georgia Tech.


The key features of course logistics for the Georgia Tech CP course are detailed below.
In total, the course lasts for a full semester (approximately 15 weeks), with an expected 8 to
15 hours of workload each week.

**Lecture Videos**


The material in the course is presented in high-quality videos. In total there are about 90
videos comprising around 30 hours of material. Van Hentenryck recorded a video for each
topic listed above with greenscreen backgrounds, animations, and more. The videos generally
have Van Hentenryck’s head superimposed on slides or images, which make for clearer and
higher quality videos compared to recordings of traditional classroom proceedings. The
videos are relatively short and digestible, with lengths ranging from 10 to 30 minutes each.
The students are able to play, pause, and rewind these videos, as well as change the playback
speed. A flipped classroom style approach is utilized where the lecture videos are posted in
advance of the scheduled class sessions. Lecture videos are complemented with interactive
online sessions that happen during the scheduled course time. An example of one of the
lecture videos can be seen below in Figure 1. The PDF files of the slides used in each lecture
video are also provided to the students.

**Interactive Sessions**


The interactive sessions take place on Zoom and focus on review of the material from the
most recent set of lecture videos. The interactive sessions include time for Q&A and go over
the course assignments. They also include one-on-one sessions in Zoom breakout rooms with
the instructors and the teaching assistants. These breakout room sessions allow students to
get customized face-to-face help. The sessions are frequently used for help with conceptual
understanding and debugging code for the assignments. The interactive sessions take place
two to three times a week for about an hour each day. Teaching assistants also offer office
hours on an ad hoc basis to help those unable to join a particular interactive session.


**Discussion Forums**


The Georgia Tech CP Course also has an attached discussion forum where students can
ask conceptual questions publicly and assignment code debugging questions in a private
post to course instructors and teaching assistants. Students may answer the questions of
their peers or leave follow-up comments and questions to others’ questions. Students are
guaranteed responses within 24 hours; however, the mean instructor (including teaching
assistants) response time is 47 minutes. The response time is often even faster than that
during the workday.


**Assignments**


The course contains many assignments that are due on a roughly weekly basis. Each
assignment relates to applying the topics covered in the lecture videos and interactive sessions
from the previous week. Each assignment can be solved with the knowledge students have
learned to that point, as well as with the existing functionalities of OPL and the OPL
IDE. Every assignment involves an application-focused modeling problem that requires a


**WTCP 2023**


**1:6** **Modern Constraint Programming Education: Lessons for the Future**


model coded in OPL as a solution. The assignments start simple with problems like map
coloring before ramping up to more difficult problems like the Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) and flood evacuation planning. Students start
with assignments from the very first week to cultivate their constraint programming mindset
and familiarize themselves with the OPL language. This is in line with the philosophy
espoused by Patrick Prosser in his CP 2014 talk, where he discussed getting students to solve
problems as soon as possible [ 8 ]. The focus in the assignments is on modeling and writing
appropriate constraints. Students in the course use the solver from IBM ILOG CP Optimizer
out of the box, rather than writing custom search procedures. There are a few assignments
towards the end of the course that involve CP in Python (due to students’ familiarity with
Python) and Mini-CP (primarily for graduates students; a way to explore writing search
procedures). Some of the introductory assignments are reused year to year, though most
of the assignments receive changes ranging from minor tweaks all the way to brand-new
exercises. Some of the assignments require data file inputs which are provided to the students.
For many of the assignments in the latter half of the course, multiple data files are provided
for testing as students devise their formulations. However, students are asked to make their
formulation general in nature, as the provided dataset to the students is not necessarily the
one used for verifying and grading their model.


**Theme**


Similar to the adoption of an Indiana Jones theme in Van Hentenryck’s earlier MOOC [ 13 ] or
the classic Chinese novel themes in Lee and Stuckey’s MOOCs [ 1, 5 ], the Georgia Tech CP
course uses a Star Wars theme. All of the lecture videos involve Star Wars-themed examples,
graphics, and even costumes! At the time of writing, a viral video of Van Hentenryck teaching
[while dressed as Yoda has garnered over 1.5 million views on TikTok. The assignments also](https://www.tiktok.com/@camille_miles/video/6999857222868126981)
all have problem descriptions pertaining to happenings in the Star Wars universe. All course
instructors are referred to as Jedi Masters (Van Hentenryck is Yoda, while Santanam is
Obi-Wan Kenobi), teaching assistants are referred to as Jedi Assistants, and students are
referred to as Padawans. At first glance, the theme may seem gimmicky, but it actually
serves to motivate the students and keep them engaged with some light-heartedness. There
is no requirement of prior Star Wars knowledge, nor does such knowledge provide a leg
up in the course. The use of the Star Wars theme, specifically, is allowed for educational
use internally. However, it would infringe on Disney’s copyright if the lecture videos and
assignments were to be public-facing.


**Student Patterns of Interaction**


It is also important to shed light on the manner in which students engage with course material.
The graph below in Figure 2 shows the average page views per student per week over the
course of a semester. Page views includes actions like viewing a lecture video, reading lecture
slides, or going to the interactive session page. The interaction pattern follows a cyclical
up and down flow. Students spend more time with the material when it is new, and then
focus on the applications as they get more used to the material. Then, when new material is
introduced, the page views jump up again. Apart from the drop near the beginning of the
semester associated with a school holiday week, interactions until Georgia Tech’s final exam
period remain consistently above 30 page views per student per week. Page views tend to
be higher in the second half of the course when there is a focus on scheduling and routing
applications in CP. In general over the years, the most watched lecture videos have been


**T. Santanam and P. Van Hentenryck** **1:7**


the videos on global constraints, sequence variables, reification, and routing. We can likely
assume that these videos reflect the topics the students found most challenging or needed
the most review on. Global constraints and reification are covered in the first half of the
course, while scheduling are routing are covered in the second half. Thus, the Georgia Tech
CP course does well at distributing these challenging topics.


**Figure 2** Average weekly student interaction with the course material over the semester


As far as patterns of interaction within the interactive session, there have been three groups
of students that have been generally observed in the course. One group of students attend
every interactive session no matter what. The second group of students attend sporadically,
which is usually only when they need help and at times close to assignment deadline. The
last group of students function independently and don’t come to any interactive sessions.
The first group of students are generally strong performers in the course and understand
the concepts well. The second group of students tend to be grade motivated and sometimes
perform well, but do not usually build a deeper understanding of CP. The third group is a
unique case where some students establish a good enough understanding from the videos
and don’t need the sessions while other students in the group are falling behind and struggle
in the course. It is important to look at the assignments of students in this third group
to identify if they need extra support or not. In addition to the grade received on the
assignment, it is also helpful to look at the way constraints are written to see if the students
has a certain maturity in their modeling. After all, there is a large difference between a
concise and effective constraint and a hardcoded constraint specific to the dataset, even if
they produce the same result.


**Reception**


To date, there have been six completed CP courses at Georgia Tech between Fall 2018 and
Spring 2023. With each iteration of the course, the popularity of the course within the
Industrial and Systems Engineering department has grown. Table 1 shows the number of
students who took each iteration of the Georgia Tech CP course. The Spring 2023 course
was intentionally set to a lower capacity as it was the first time the course was offered
in back-to-back semesters. At the time of writing, the upcoming Fall 2023 course has 96
students registered with a further 33 on the waitlist. Enrollment in the Georgia Tech CP
course has had full registration with spillover onto waitlists in every semester since Fall 2019.


**Table 1** Enrollment for past iterations of the Georgia Tech CP course

|Semester|Fall 2018|Fall 2019|Fall 2020|Fall 2021|Fall 2022|Spring 2023|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Enrollment|26|41|94|100|183|30|



Despite the growth in enrollment, the quality of the Georgia Tech CP course has been

maintained. Surveys were given to all students in the last five iterations of the course. Some
questions with average ratings on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being the lowest possible rating and 5
being the highest possible rating, are shown in Table 2 below. The course has maintained
consistently high ratings since its inception.


**Table 2** Survey ratings for past iterations of the Georgia Tech CP course

|Semester|Fall 2019|Fall 2020|Fall 2021|Fall 2022|Spring 2023|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Number of Respondents|15|82|93|153|26|
|Amount Learned|4.9|4.8|4.5|4.4|4.6|
|Instructor stimulates interest|4.9|4.95|4.8|4.6|4.8|
|Instructor efectiveness|5|4.97|4.9|4.7|4.7|

Some written feedback from the surveys can be seen below:


“The structure was well organized to incrementally build our familiarity with the material.
The flipped classroom format was also effective, in being able to review the recordings
several times, as well as being able to revisit the recordings later in the semester. The in
class sessions were useful to solidify our understanding.”
“The lecture videos were high quality and engaging. The professor themed the entire course
and the amount of effort he put into making it work in a virtual format is commendable!
I loved that I could watch and re-watch the lecture videos as many times as I needed to.
The interactive sessions were a must have. Getting to interact with the professor after
having watched the lecture videos and read through the assignments really helped and he
generally gave great pointers and advice. The breakout rooms were must haves as well
as often the questions I wanted to ask would not have been appropriate to ask to the
class. Finally, I thought the assignments were incredible benchmarks for whether or not
we fully grasped and could synthesize many concepts from the course.”
“I really enjoyed a lot of the assignments, and the theme of the course was perfect. I
am a huge star wars fan (currently getting through all of the animated shows which I
highly recommend), and the fun assignments made me want to complete them and I
always looked forward to the story of the assignments. The interactive sessions were also
super helpful and an amazing idea. I always got great help there especially in the 1-to-1

breakout rooms.”

“It is hard to say because there were so many things that I loved about the way this class
was taught. 1. I would say the interactive sessions (at a convenient (5 PM) after my
full-time job) and the Ed Discussion were some of the best features for getting help; I
felt like I was able to get the face-to-face and virtual support I needed way more than in
other classes I’ve taken. The professor and TAs went out of their way to make themselves
available in this class, way more than in other classes. In other classes, I have had to seek
out help more, and it is harder as a Distance Learning student to ask questions without
the ability to do so in real-time. But this class does it! 2. As a close second, having our
grades be based on assignments is the way I like to learn – learning by applying and
doing (rather than solely being tested on theory).”


In addition to the favorable enrollment and positive survey results, the Georgia Tech CP
course has received further accolades. The course received the Teaching Excellence Award
for Online Teaching and the Student Recognition of Excellence in Teaching: Class of 1934


**T. Santanam and P. Van Hentenryck** **1:9**


Award for the Fall 2020 iteration of the course. Furthermore, the course received the Student
Recognition of Excellence in Teaching: CIOS Honor Roll for the Fall 2020, Fall 2021, and
Fall 2022 iterations of the course, an award reserved for teaching excellence with large class

sizes.


**3** **Lessons Learned**


Over the many iterations of the Georgia Tech CP course, both the authors have gained
numerous insights into the learning process. Van Hentenryck has been instructing the course
since its inception, while Santanam has been involved in every iteration of the course for
the last four years as either a student, teaching assistant, or instructor. Some key areas of
emphasis are expounded upon below.


**Teaching to Undergraduate Students**


One of the unique parts of the Georgia Tech CP course is the large presence of undergraduate
students each year. In every iteration of the course, undergraduate students have comprised at
least 75% of the class. Given the audience, this necessitates a different approach to CP than
what one might generally see at most universities. Given their age and relative inexperience
in the field, it is much more important to cultivate an interest in CP (or optimization in
general) in each student. The Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering degree at Georgia
Tech has specializations in analytics, statistics, economics, operations research, supply chain,
and a general studies track as well. It is very likely that the majority of students in the class
have other backgrounds and interest. Thus, many who take the CP course are doing so to
learn something new, rather than trying to build upon a longstanding interest. It is for this
reason that teaching in an engaging way is important. Presenting the real-world applications
of CP and allowing undergraduate students to get hands-on with modeling early in the course
is vital to enable a student to realize their interest or disinterest in the subject. A focus
on real-world applications is also helpful for an undergraduate audience due to the large
percentage of undergraduate students that go straight to work in industry upon completing
their degree. For them, the focus is on developing the modeling skills and the problem-solving
mindset over the theoretical underpinnings one might expect a graduate student to care
more about. A last distinctive adaptation needed when teaching to undergraduate audiences
is the role of coding in a CP course. At an undergraduate level, many students lack the
coding maturity that allows one to take a new programming language and efficiently write
the necessary syntax to execute on an ideated model. Learning a new programming language
in OPL is a difficult task for many, and most undergraduate students lack the full ability
to teach themselves new syntax solely by reading documentation. Undergraduate students
require and continually ask for a good deal of coding examples and demonstrations, as well
as help debugging and interpreting documentation. Thus, when teaching to undergraduate
students, it is important to make the coding parts of a course as accessible as possible. One
must decidedly think of coding exercises as a means to enable the building of CP-related
intuition in undergraduate students and lower the barriers to entry there.


**Teaching to Engineering Students**


Another novel aspect of the Georgia Tech CP course is that it is housed within the Industrial
and Systems Engineering Department inside the College of Engineering. The majority of
CP courses around the world are taught by computer science faculty to computer science


**WTCP 2023**


**1:10** **Modern Constraint Programming Education: Lessons for the Future**


students, as opposed to the setup at Georgia Tech. Teaching CP to engineering students
also requires careful consideration in pedagogical choices. Since the students hail from an
engineering background, they tend to be very focused on the impact that CP-driven processes
have on real-world systems. Most students seem to be more motivated by those outcomes
CP can drive rather than by the inner workings of CP itself. For that reason, the Georgia
Tech CP course has videos on real-world case studies. For example, Van Hentenryck presents
two videos detailing applications of CP for integrated container terminal operations and
scheduling at ports. The coding aspect of CP is also somewhere where engineering students
may not be as advanced as their computer science peers. At Georgia Tech, students only
have exposure to two semesters of Python before taking Constraint Programming. This can
make it difficult for some students in learning a new programming language, and may lead
to difficulties in debugging or expressing complex constraints.


**Modeling-Focused Teaching**


One of the main ways that the Georgia Tech CP course makes the subject more accessible
at an introductory level is through a strong focus on writing CP models. The emphasis on
modeling helps students understand how to breakdown a problem from a CP perspective
and express it via a set of constraints. Since the students (particularly undergraduates in
engineering) are motivated by the applications of CP, the use of black-box solvers serves
to expedite the process as a whole and allows a student to go from problem to results and
output much quicker. Largely limiting the instruction and assessment to modeling enables
instructional staff to reclaim time that can be used to add depth or breadth in applications
of CP. By way of the modeling emphasis, students also learn about elegance in model
formulation and are encouraged to write constraints multiple different ways. Students end
up generating a wide variety of creative formulations. Details and concepts behind search
procedures and CP solvers are covered in the course, but the emphasis on the assignments
largely shifts away from that.


**Autograders**


In order to teach the Georgia Tech CP course to hundreds of students every year, an
autograder system had to be implemented for efficient grading. Manually having instructors
and teaching assistants run each model and verify each solution would be inefficient. For the
Georgia Tech CP course, a master Python script takes all the model files submitted by the
students and runs them a few at a time. The model files produce an output in a format that
is pre-specified in the assignment instructions. Students are encouraged to model however
they want with whatever variables they want. Normally, a wide range of formulations are
seen. The only ask is to convert their output into the pre-specified output which usually
comprises a trivial post-processing step. An OPL script is then used to verify if the students’
solutions are feasible and/or optimal. The results on each model’s correctness is written
to a CSV file that instructional staff can use for grading. Students who did not pass the
autograder have their models manually checked for partial credit and are given feedback on
where errors were committed. Without this kind of autograder system, countless additional
hours would have to be spent by course instructional staff every semester. The lack of an
autograder system would mean having to set a lower capacity limit on the course. Thus, such
a system enables the spreading of CP education to larger numbers of students and reduces
the marginal cost of time and effort required for each additional students. In general, any
course, whether in-person or online, or MOOC or university-based, would be recommend


**T. Santanam and P. Van Hentenryck** **1:11**


to have an autograder. Thanks to the fact that we can verify the solutions to NP-complete
problems in polynomial time, the autograder ensures fairness and consistency in grading,
doing so in a timely manner.


**Engaging Large Audiences**


Ensuring that every students stays engaged, interested, and has their educational needs met
is one of the most challenging things to do as an instructor. Especially when delivering CP
MOOCs or large CP classes over 100 students, connecting with each and every students
may seem like a daunting tasks. There are, however, a few strategies that one can employ.
The first method is to make the learning environment and process as fun as possible. In the
Georgia Tech CP course, this is achieved through immersion in the Star Wars theme. All
videos and assignments are tinged with Star Wars lore, characters, locations, and more. The
illusion is kept up in both verbal and written communication from the instructional staff,
who only use the Star Wars names for themselves. Within the interactive sessions on Zoom,
instructional staff also have their Zoom backgrounds set to Star Wars-related imagery. For
many students, this can bring a lightheartedness to the class by relating a new, daunting
subject with something familiar. Other students may also find the journey of “becoming
a Jedi“ motivating and place themselves within the story as they strive to complete their
assignments as part of their mission. In addition to a fun theme, engaging large audiences
required multiple potential points of engagement with students. In the Georgia Tech CP
course, students can access the content via lecture videos 24/7, while also having interactive
sessions multiple times a week. These interactive sessions allow for tighter knit review, in

addition to one-on-one interactions with each student in attendance. For students with

schedule or time zone issues (especially in the case of online courses and MOOCs), interaction
via a discussion or Q&A forum is yet another option. Lastly, ad hoc touchpoints with any
member of the instructional staff makes learning and assignment help available for every
student. The last method for large audience engagement is about accommodation of different
learning styles. For those who learn by watching, videos are a great solution. Those who
prefer to read can review the posted PDF lecture slide handouts. Students who learn “by
doing“ can code along with demos and gain numerous opportunities for practice through
the weekly hands-on assignments. Students who learn through one-on-one discussion find
the breakout rooms in the interactive sessions useful, while those students who do not need
any help on particular assignments are not required to engage with any of the resources; the
materials and touchpoints for help are there as and when each student needs them.


**Teaching via Distance Learning**


Delivering a successful online course requires a reliable set of technologies to produce a
quality student experience. It can never be overstated how important good audio and video
equipment is in creating high-quality videos. Students need to be able to clearly see and hear
instruction in order to properly internalize it. Additional work in animation and graphics
is helpful but not required; clear content is more important than theatrics. Beyond lecture
video production, tools for interactive video sessions and breakout rooms are also vital for
seamless transition between small group and one-on-one environments. The Georgia Tech CP
course has used both Zoom and BlueJeans effectively in the past. A proper discussion forum
that handles question and answer posts between students and instructional staff is a useful
tool for communication, debugging, and conceptual help offline outside of interactive sessions.
The Georgia Tech CP course has used both Ed Discussion and Piazza. In a large online


**WTCP 2023**


**1:12** **Modern Constraint Programming Education: Lessons for the Future**


environment where students are not all located in the same place, empowering students to
help other students in the discussion forums foments greater understanding of the material
between students. This can happen holistically, but it may behoove a CP instructor to offer
extra credit or some similar incentive for answering the questions of peers. For overall course
structure, housing course materials, announcements, and links in a learning management site
like Canvas, Sakai, or Google Classroom can also be beneficial organizationally. Lastly, it
is important to check in with students that one may see really struggling or falling behind.
Without seeing the students physically in the classroom, it can be easy for students to fall
through the cracks due to the isolation. Instructional staff may also not be fully aware of
the extent of a student’s personal situation. For any students that are falling behind, it is
generally good practice to reach out and inquire on ways to accommodate or assist them.


**4** **The Future of CP Education**


The lessons presented above offer some thoughts and guidance for constructing a successful
CP course in modern times. However, looking ahead to the future, there will need to be
further adaptations and changes within the CP community as a whole to ensure the long-term
growth of CP in both the education and research spheres.


**Promotion of CP**


One of the main obstacles facing CP education going forward has to do with promotion.
The fact of the matter is, CP is a form of artificial intelligence (AI). However, this fact is
grossly understated in educational spheres. The machine learning (ML) community has so
tightly hitched their wagon to AI that many members of the general (and scientific) public
often conflate the two and use the terms AI and ML interchangeably. This is not to say
that CP must suddenly match ML in terms of media coverage and hype, but the way the
CP community positions the subject can have a great impact on the desire of new students
wanting to take an introductory course in CP. If one were to describe CP as AI that solves
Sudoku in milliseconds and powers delivery systems within massive supply chains, this line
of messaging could be more appealing to young students today. The challenge of CP relative
to fields like ML is also something that could be spoken about more when promoting to
young students in computer science and engineering. ML at an introductory level is largely
a problem of organizing data appropriately and putting it into a black-box function that
provides a trained model. On the other hand, even at the most introductory stages, CP
involves writing out a uniquely customized and specific model for each problem and going a
step beyond data organization in order to solve problems. The additional skill needed here is
something that could prove appealing to students and motivate them in their CP journey.


**Introductory CP Resources**


Another positive development with regards to CP education would be greater availability of
introductory resources, especially at the undergraduate level. To use the ML community as
a point of comparison yet again, undergraduate learners can easily sink their teeth into _An_
_Introduction to Statistical Learning_ [ 4 ], which is also fairly standardized and used at many
universities across the world. The mathematical programming community also has fairly
standard undergraduate-level introductory texts like _Optimization in Operations Research_ [ 9 ]
and _Operations Research: Applications and Algorithms_ [ 15 ]. It would be beneficial to the CP
community to have such approachable texts with relative standardization in adoption across


**T. Santanam and P. Van Hentenryck** **1:13**


universities. The focus of this kind of text should be strongly in the applied realm. From
experience, undergraduate students are often loathe to dive into textbooks with numerous
theorems and proofs. Rather, they would prefer a book with numerous worked examples
and code samples showing toy examples of real-world applications. A book that does this
well in the ML field is _Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_

[ 2 ]. Of course, a textbook is not the only solution to this problem, but a standardized
collection of introductory-level information along with a guide or outline that instructors can
follow would be extremely beneficial, be it a textbook or an organized website. However, in
presenting application-driven textbooks and other resources, the CP community must also
standardize more on the set of tools used to introduce coding to students. In the ML world,
most students first use Python with libraries like Scikit-learn [ 7 ]. In the CP world, there are
multiple different languages used across many introductory courses. Rather than potentially
overwhelming students with the choice between OR-Tools, MiniZinc, CPLEX, Mini-CP, and
more, it would be better for the community as a whole to focus in on specific languages and
solvers to use when educating newcomers to the subject. It may seem unlikely after 40 years
of CP that the community would suddenly align on a set of tools, but adjustments to at
least focus on a smaller subset would be a step in the right direction.


**Availability of CP Courses**


Further proliferation of CP courses at both the university level and MOOCs is vital for the
survival and growth of CP as a practice. Comparing again to ML, almost every university
with a computer science, math, or engineering department these days has at least one course
in ML. Similarly, there are innumerable websites with online courses for ML topics at all levels.
The CP community should place special focus on outreach to schools without CP courses
or faculty members with a CP background. Furthermore, continued promotion of existing
MOOCs along with the development of new MOOCs will help perpetuate a virtuous cycle.
Without new students and the continued development of those starting their CP journeys,
new researchers in CP cannot be trained and cannot go on to spread their ideas around the
world. The fact of the matter is that CP education and CP research go hand in hand. One
cannot survive without the other. Thus, a focus on teaching CP will ultimately derive benefits
in the research sphere as well. Additionally, the updating of centralized lists of CP courses like
[the one found on Pearltrees (http://www.pearltrees.com/constraints/courses/id39842792)](http://www.pearltrees.com/constraints/courses/id39842792)
would be helpful to students in finding educational resources, as well as helpful to instructors
to gain inspiration on ways to improve their own CP courses.


**The Impact of Large Language Models**


Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a fundamental challenge / threat for every projectbased course. Constraint programming is no exception. ChatGPT was run on the assignments
for the Georgia Tech CP course. The results were stunning. On the early assignments,
ChatGPT essentially produced the correct models. As the assignments got more involved,
ChatGPT output models that were close to the solutions, but typically had syntax or type
errors. However, these models certainly give students a strong basis to start from. Figure
3 shows a model for an assignment that abstracts a real problem. This assignment is the
first in the second part of the course, where the projects get more realistic. ChatGPT, at
this point, struggles for the third part of the class, which is heavily based on scheduling and

routing.
Assignments are changed every year in the Georgia Tech CP class, but they build around

the same core problems. If students have access to a model from previous years (which they
are forbidden to do), it is conceivable that LLMs will fill the gap, putting increasing burden
on instructors to fundamentally change assignments each year and create assignments that
are radically different. Or, perhaps, in a world where LLMs will become a fundamental
tool, it becomes important to rethink entirely how modeling and problem-solving courses are
taught.


**5** **Conclusion**


The Georgia Tech CP course detailed in this paper demonstrates some novel ways to teach
an introductory online CP course. The lecture videos and interactive sessions provide a
fun way to mix large-scale instruction with focused efforts in small groups and one-on-one
settings. The focus on modeling and solving applied problems helps hone the problem solving
intuition of students while shoring up their coding skills.
The paper also discusses the adaptations needed when working with students from
backgrounds like undergraduate engineering. Further observations are made on the use of
technology in autograding and distance learning. Some thoughts from the authors on future
directions of CP education (especially at an introductory level) are also discussed along with
actionable recommendations for their implementation.
Ultimately, the experiences and thoughts put forward in this paper only comprise observations in a small segment of the CP community. It would be most beneficial to have
discussions with CP educators around the world to learn more about other ways of effectively
teaching the subject.
