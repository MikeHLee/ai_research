# Graph Traversal and Optimization

## Overview

Graph traversal problems involve finding paths, cycles, or structures in graphs subject to various constraints. These problems are fundamental to network optimization, routing, and scheduling.

## Basic Graph Representations

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, n_vertices, directed=False):
        self.n = n_vertices
        self.directed = directed
        self.adj_list = {i: [] for i in range(n_vertices)}
        self.edges = []
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        """Add edge from u to v with optional weight"""
        self.adj_list[u].append((v, weight))
        self.edges.append((u, v, weight))
        
        if not self.directed:
            self.adj_list[v].append((u, weight))
    
    def get_neighbors(self, u):
        """Get neighbors of vertex u"""
        return self.adj_list[u]
```

## Classic Traversal Algorithms

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS)

```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    """
    Depth-first search traversal
    Time: O(V + E)
    """
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    
    visited.add(start)
    print(f"Visiting: {start}")
    
    for neighbor, _ in graph.get_neighbors(start):
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    
    return visited


def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    """
    Iterative DFS using stack
    """
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    
    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()
        
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            print(f"Visiting: {vertex}")
            
            # Add neighbors to stack
            for neighbor, _ in graph.get_neighbors(vertex):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)
    
    return visited
```

### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    """
    Breadth-first search traversal
    Time: O(V + E)
    """
    visited = set([start])
    queue = deque([start])
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        print(f"Visiting: {vertex}")
        
        for neighbor, _ in graph.get_neighbors(vertex):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return visited


def bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    """
    Find shortest path using BFS (unweighted graph)
    """
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    
    while queue:
        vertex, path = queue.popleft()
        
        if vertex == end:
            return path
        
        for neighbor, _ in graph.get_neighbors(vertex):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    
    return None  # No path found

## Applications

### 1. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

```python
def tsp_dynamic_programming(distances):
    """
    TSP using dynamic programming (Held-Karp)
    Time: O(nÂ² 2â¿)
    """
    n = len(distances)
    
    # dp[mask][i] = minimum cost to visit cities in mask, ending at i
    dp = {}
    
    # Base case: start from city 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[(1 << i, i)] = distances[0][i]
    
    # Fill DP table
    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
        for last in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1 << last)):
                continue
            
            prev_mask = mask ^ (1 << last)
            
            for prev in range(n):

### 2. Vehicle Routing with Time Windows

```python
def vrp_with_time_windows(customers, vehicles, depot):
    """
    Vehicle routing with time windows constraint
    Each customer must be visited within their time window
    """
    # This is typically solved using:
    # - Column generation
    # - Branch and price
    # - Metaheuristics (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing)
    pass
```

## Summary

Graph traversal and optimization encompasses:
- **Basic traversal**: DFS, BFS
- **Shortest paths**: Dijkstra, A*, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
- **Constrained paths**: Resource limits, time-dependent, k-shortest
- **Cycles**: Detection, enumeration
- **Spanning trees**: Kruskal, Prim
- **Network flows**: Max flow, min cost flow
- **Complex routing**: TSP, VRP variants
